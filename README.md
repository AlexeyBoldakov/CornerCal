# StatusCal - a better clock app for macOS

This project is a fork of the [ekreutz/CornerCal](https://github.com/ekreutz/CornerCal)  with some changes. 

Download latest version: [StatusCal.dmg.zip](https://github.com/AlexeyBoldakov/StatusCal/raw/master/builds/StatusCal.dmg.zip) (supports macOS Mojave 10.14 and higher)



*Pro tip:* In macOS Sierra and later, you can reorganize your status bar by holding `âŒ˜` while dragging things around. You can also hide the native clock app from the system settings, in order to avoid clutter. 



Note: this app looks great in Mojave's Dark Mode as well!
